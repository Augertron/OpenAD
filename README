1. Get the rest of the repository using 'goad'.  

('goad' is a tool for getting and updating OpenAD repositories.  It
can be customized to support many disparate repositories and
non-standard local installations of the same, but this feature will
typically only be used by developers who need repository write access
or the ability to switch betweeen different versions of a local
repository.)

Developers should at check the configuration file, openad_config.pm,
and at least verify the setting of 
  riceUser
  $OPENAD_REPO_RICECVS->{rsh}
  anlUser

  ./bin/goad

*** Make sure you have your private ANL SSH key.

2. Set the environment

  (The environment settings are built dynamically using the
  configuration file, openad_config.pm.  No need to tinker.)

  source setenv.sh -or- source setenv.csh
  
3. Build

*** WARNING *** 
At the moment this make doesn't properly handle partial rebuilds for
repositories like OpenAnalysis.  Instead OpenAnalysis will be
completely rebuilt each time.  I'll fix this in the future.
*** WARNING *** 

For some reason Open64 breaks when built recursively from make. How lame.

   cd ${OPEN64ROOT}/crayf90/sgi
   make

   cd ${OPEN64ROOT}/whirl2f 
   make

   cd ${OPEN64ROOT}/ir_tools
   make

Build other things with a sane build system

  cd ${OPENADROOT}
  make
