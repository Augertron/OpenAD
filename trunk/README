1. Get the rest of the repository using 'goad'.  

('goad' is a tool for getting and updating OpenAD repositories.  It
can be customized to support many disparate repositories and
non-standard local installations of the same, but this feature will
typically only be used by developers who need repository write access
or the ability to switch betweeen different versions of a local
repository.)

Developers should check the configuration file, openad_config.pm,
and at least verify the setting of 
  riceUser
  $OPENAD_REPO_RICECVS->{rsh}
  anlUser

  ./bin/goad

*** Make sure you have your private ANL SSH key.

2. Set the environment

  (The environment settings are built dynamically using the
  configuration file, openad_config.pm.  No need to tinker.)

  source ./setenv.sh   -or-   source ./setenv.csh
  
3. Build

  cd ${OPENADROOT}
  make
