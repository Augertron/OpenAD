2. Temporary Getting and Building Instructions:
-----------------------------------------------

1. Get the rest of the repository using 'goad'.  

  ('goad' is a tool for getting and updating OpenAD repositories.  It
  can be customized to support many disparate repositories and
  non-standard local installations of the same, but this feature will
  typically only be used by developers who need repository write access
  or the ability to switch betweeen different versions of a local
  repository.)

  The default setup allows read-only access to the repositories with 
  the following command: 

  	./bin/goad

2. Set the environment:

  (The environment settings are built dynamically using the
  configuration file, openad_config.pm.  No need to tinker.)

  	source ./setenv.sh   -or-   source ./setenv.csh
  
3. Build

 	cd ${OPENADROOT}
  	make

4. Write Access for Developers

  Developers seeking write access should check the configuration file, 
  openad_config.pm, and verify the setting of 
    riceUser
    $OPENAD_REPO_RICECVS->{rsh}
    anlUser
  Refer to the website for 
  further information.
